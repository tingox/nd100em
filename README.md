This is a copy of the original code repository (to be precise, of the v0.2.4 tarball), because the original site has been offline 
for a few years now, and the domain has expired.

Requirements
[libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig.html) is required. 
There is a FreeBSD port [devel/libconfig](https://www.freshports.org/devel/libconfig/).
