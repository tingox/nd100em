# nd100em
Norsk Data ND100 emulator

See [ND100 emulator project](http://www.ndwiki.org/wiki/ND100_emulator_project) at [NDwiki](http://www.ndwiki.org/).
This is a copy of the original code repository (to be precise, of the v0.2.4 tarball), because the original site has been offline 
for a few years now, and the domain has expired.

For a more working emulator, look at RonnyA's fork:  [nd100em](https://github.com/RonnyA/nd100em) (check out the floppy branch).
Or jdo-geek's fork: [nd100em](https://github.com/jdo-geek/nd100em) - you will have to look at branches here too.

Requirements
[libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig.html) is required. 
There is a FreeBSD port [devel/libconfig](https://www.freshports.org/devel/libconfig/).
